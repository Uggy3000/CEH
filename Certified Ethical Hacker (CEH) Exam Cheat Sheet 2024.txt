Sniffing and Evasion
IPV4 AND IPV6
IPv4 == unicast, multicast, and broadcast
IPv6 == unicast, multicast, and anycast.
IPv6 unicast and multicast scope includes link local, site local and global.

MAC ADDRESS
First half = 3 bytes (24bits) = Org UID
Second half = unique number

NAT (NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION)
Basic NAT is a one-to-one mapping where each internal IP== a unique public IP.
Nat overload (PAT) == port address translation. Typically used as is the cheaper option.

STATEFUL INSPECTION
Concerned with the connections. Doesn’t sniff ever packet, it just verifies if it’s a known connection, then passes along.

HTTP TUNNELLING
Crafting of wrapped segments through a port rarely filtered by the Firewall (e.g., 80) to carry payloads that may otherwise be blocked.

IDS EVASION TACTICS
Slow down OR flood the network (and sneak through in the mix) OR fragmentation

TCPDUMP SYNTAX
#~tcpdump flag(s) interface

SNORT IDS	
It has 3 modes:	Sniffer/Packet logger/ Network IDS.
Config file: /etc/snort, or c:snortetc #~alert tcp!HOME_NET any ->$HOME_NET 31337 (msg : “BACKDOOR ATTEMPT-Back-orifice.”)	Any packet from any address !=home network. Using any source port, intended for an address in home network on port 31337, send msg.
Span port: port mirroring	False Negative: IDS incorrectly reports stream clean

Attacking a System
C|EH RULES FOR PASSWORDS
Must not contain user’s name. Min 8 chars.
3 of 4 complexity components. E.g., Special, Number, Uppercase, Lowercase

ATTACK TYPES
Passive Online: Sniffing wire, intercept clean text password / replay / MITM
Active Online: Password guessing.
Offline: Steal copy of password i.e., SAM file. Cracking efforts on a separate system
Non-electronic: Social Engineering

SIDEJACKING
Steal cookies exchanged between systems and use tp perform a replay-style attack.

SESSION HIJACKING
Refers to the active attempt to steal an entire established session from a target
1. Sniff traffic between client and server
2. Monitor traffic and predict sequence
3. Desynchronise session with client
4. Predict session token and take over session
5. Inject packets to the target server

AUTHENTICATION TYPES
Type 1: Something you know
Type 2: Something you have
Type 3: Something you are

KERBEROS
Kerberos makes use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption technologies and involves:
KDC: Key Distribution Centre
AS: Authentication Service
TGS: Ticket Granting Service
TGT: Ticket Granting Ticket
Process
1. Client asks KDC (who has AS and TGS) for ticket to authenticate throughout the network. this request is in clear text.
2. Server responds with secret key. hashed by the password copy kept on AD server (TGT).
3. TGT sent back to server requesting TGS if user decrypts.
4. Server responds with ticket, and client can log on and access network resources.

REGISTRY
2 elements make a registry setting: a key (location pointer), and value (define the key setting).
Rot level keys are as follows:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_Info on Hard/software
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT ― Info on file associations and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) classes
HKEY_CURRENT_USER ― Profile info on current user
HKEY_USERS ― User config info for all active users
HEKY_CURRENT-CONFIG―pointer tohardware Profiles.
HEKY_LOCAL-MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersion

Outsider Affiliates: Non-trusted outsider that use an access point that was left open

Physical Security
3 MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES
Physical measures: Things you taste, touch, smell
Technical measures: smart cards, biometrics
Operational measures: policies and procedures

Web-Based Hacking
CSRF – CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY
DOT-DOT-SLASH ATTACK
Variant of Unicode or un-validated input attack
SQL INJECTION ATTACK TYPES
Union Query: Use the UNION command to return the union of target Db with a crafted Db
Tautology: Term used to describe behavior of a Db when deciding if a statement is true.
Blind SQL Injection: Trial and Error with no responses or prompts.
Error based SQL Injection: Enumeration technique. Inject poorly constructed commands to have Db respond with table names and other information

BUFFER OVERFLOW
A condition that occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it has space to store and results in data corruption. Caused by insufficient bounds checking, a bug, or poor configuration in the program code.
Stack: Premise is all program calls are kept in a stack and performed in order. Try to change a function pointer or variable to allow code exe
Heap: Takes advantage of memory “on top of” the application (dynamically allocated). Use program to overwrite function pointers
NOP Sled: Takes advantage of instruction called “no-op”. Sends a large # of NOP instructions into buffer. Most IDS protect from this attack.
Dangerous SQL functions
The following do not check size of destination buffers: gets() strcpy() stract() printf()


Wireless  Network Hacking
WIRELESS SNIFFING
Compatible wireless adapter with promiscuous mode is required, but otherwise pretty much the same as sniffing wired.

Camo: Disguise as legit files.
Cavity: Hides in empty areas in exe.
Marco: Written in MS Office Macro Language
Multipartite: Attempts to infect files and boot sector at same time.
Metamorphic virus: Rewrites itself when it infects a new file.
Network: Spreads via network shares.
Polymorphic virus: Constantly changing signature makes it hard to detect.
Shell virus: Like boot sector but wrapped around application code, and run on application start.
Stealth: Hides in files, copies itself to deliver payload.

DOS TYPES	
SYN Attack:	Send thousands of SYN packets with a false IP address. Target will attempt SYN/ACK response. All machine resources will be engaged.
SYN Flood:	Send thousands of SYN Packets but never respond to any of the returned SYN/ACK packets. Target will run out of available connections.
ICMP Flood:	Send ICMP Echo packets with a fake source address. Target attempts to respond but reaches a limit of packets sent per second.
Application level:	Send “legitimate” traffic to a web application than it can handle.
Smurf:	Send large number of pings to the broadcast address of the subnet with source IP spoofed to target. Subnet will send ping responses to target.
Fraggle Attack:	Similar to Smurf but uses UDP.
Ping of Death:	Attacker fragments ICMP message to send to target. When the fragments are reassembled, the resultant ICMP packet is larger than max size and crashes the system

NIST:

Cloud auditor

A cloud auditor is a party that can perform an independent examination of cloud service controls with the intent to express an opinion thereon. Audits are performed to verify conformance to standards through a review of objective evidence.

Cloud broker

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_broker

Cloud Broker is an entity that manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between cloud providers and cloud consumers. As cloud computing evolves, the integration of cloud services may be too complex for cloud consumers to manage alone.

Cloud broker and its interactions with other parties

In such cases, a cloud consumer may request cloud services from a cloud broker, instead of contacting a cloud provider directly," according to NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture.

Cloud consumer

The cloud consumer is the principal stakeholder for the cloud computing service. A cloud consumer represents a person or organization that maintains a business relationship with, and uses the service from a cloud provider. A cloud consumer browses the service catalog from a cloud provider, requests the appropriate service, sets up service contracts with the cloud provider, and uses the service.

Cloud carrier

A carrier cloud is a class of cloud that integrates wide area networks (WAN) and other attributes of communications service providers’ carrier-grade networks to enable the deployment of highly demanding applications in the cloud. In contrast, classic cloud computing focuses on the data center, and does not address the network connecting data centers and cloud users. This may result in unpredictable response times and security issues when business-critical data are transferred over the Internet.


EC-Council's training materials:

Tier-1: Developer machines - image creation, testing and accreditation

Tier-2: Testing and accreditation systems - verification and validation of image contents, signing images and sending them to the registries

Tier-3: Registries - storing images and disseminating images to the orchestrators based on requests

Tier-4: Orchestrators - transforming images into containers and deploying containers to hosts

Tier-5: Hosts - operating and managing containers as instructed by the orchestrator


SSL/TLS

SSLv2 - DROWN attack

OpenSSL - heartbleed 

SQL hacking and examples

Out-of-band SQLi - leverages a database server’s ability to make DNS requests to pass data to an attacker 

In-band SQL injection is the most common and easy-to-exploit of SQL injection attacks. In-band SQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

- Union-based SQLi

Union-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response.

- Time-based blind SQLi

Time-based SQL injection is an inferential SQL injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the database to wait for a specified amount of time (in seconds) before responding. The response time will indicate to the attacker whether the result of the query is TRUE or FALSE.
